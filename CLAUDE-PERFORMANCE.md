### ‚ö° PERFORMANCE TIPS

1. **Batch Everything**: Never operate on single files when multiple are needed
2. **Parallel First**: Always think "what can run simultaneously?"
3. **Memory is Key**: Use memory for ALL cross-agent coordination
4. **Monitor Progress**: Use `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_monitor` for real-time tracking
5. **Auto-Optimize**: Let hooks handle topology and agent selection
